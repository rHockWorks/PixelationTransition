/*  PIXELATE : APPLYING THE CORE IMAGE FILTER TO THE SKEffectNode NODE (A SUBCLASS OF SKNode) WILL AFFECT ALL CHILD NODES
    WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MOVED IN THE locateNodesToPixelate FUNCTION CALL WHEN THE SCENE BEGAN (didMove).
 
    IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE PIXELATION DEGRADATION EFFECT EACH OF THE 20 TRANSITIONS MUST BE SEEN WHEN THE FILTER IS APPLIED.
    THIS COMPARRED TO THE USUAL SINGLE OUTPUTTED IMAGE.
 
    FOR THIS TO WORK WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN AN ENTIRE SCENE IT IS PLACED ON THREAD OF ITS OWN VIA DispatchQueue.
 
    THE FILTER IS PLACED INSIDE A LOOP OF 20 ITTERATIONS, WITH A SUM TO CALCULATE HOW LONG TO PAUSE FOR EACH TRANSITION.
